<b>Abstract:</b> This talk will present a sequence of empirical research studies on expert and novice mathematical reading.  In a first study, experts and undergraduates studied purported mathematical proofs while their eye-movements were tracked.  We found that experts focused more on the words (rather than the algebra) and shifted their attention in a manner consistent with searching for implicit warrants.  In a second, experimental study, undergraduates received self-explanation training or a control activity before reading a mathematical proof and taking a comprehension test.  We found that those who had received the training exhibited more expert-like mathematical reading and higher performance in a comprehension test.  In a third study, also experimental, undergraduates studied self-explanation training or a control activity in a regular lecture, then read a proof and completed a comprehension test; they also completed a delayed post-test three weeks later.  We found that the self-explanation training was effective also in this context.  I will discuss implications for teaching effective reading of mathematical text.
