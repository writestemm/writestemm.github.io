<b>Vivek Tewary</b> is Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the School of Interwoven Arts and Sciences, Krea University working on analysis of partial differential equations. Specifically, he works on the theory of homogenisation â€” the study of small-scale heterogeneities in physical models; and regularity theory of elliptic and parabolic equations which is about smoothness of solutions in different function spaces. His research is informed by ideas from physics and engineering and he wishes to learn from and work with people in those disciplines. Along with Sayantan Datta, he teaches a writing course in Mathematics. More can be found at <a href="https://vivektewary.github.io" target="_blank">vivektewary.github.io</a>.
