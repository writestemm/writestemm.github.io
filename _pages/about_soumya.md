<b>Soumya Dey</b> is a mathematician broadly interested in Geometry and Topology. He has a keen interest in mathematics education at undergraduate and school level.

Dr Dey graduated with a PhD in Mathematics from IISER Mohali in 2018, after completing BSc (Hons) in Mathematics from St Xavierâ€™s College, Kolkata, and MSc in Mathematics from RKM Vivekananda University, Belur. Thereafter, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at IISER Bhopal, the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai and Chennai Mathematical Institute, Kelambakkam successively, before joining Krea University in 2022.

As part of his doctoral thesis, Dr Dey computed explicit presentations with finite generating sets for the commutator subgroups of some generalised braid groups. As a postdoc, he started working on mapping class groups of surfaces, singular braid groups, and related infinite groups.

Dr Dey strongly believes that active discussion and collaboration is an indispensable part of doing mathematics, and this culture should be inculcated into undergraduate classrooms. He co-organised several conferences, workshops and seminars, at both national and international levels, which are aimed at researchers and graduate students. Also, he has been actively involved in math and science outreach activities for students and teachers in schools and colleges.
