> ##### **CONCEPT NOTE**
>
> The science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) ecosystem in India is increasingly recognising the importance of teaching its learners and practitioners how to read and write within and across disciplines. For example, in addition to the National Education Policy (NEP; 2020) recognising foundational reading and writing skills as “basic learning requirements” (p. 08), the draft Science, Technology and Innovation Policy (STIP; 2021) declares an intention to introduce science communication courses at “all levels of education” (p. 44), and the incorporation of science communication skill sets (which presumably include reading and writing in different genres) across different levels of scientific training. Notably, for the STIP, ‘science communication’ is not limited to the transmission of scientific knowledge to non-expert audiences. Instead, the STIP offers a definition of science communication that comprises both science “outreach” and “inreach” (p. 43); while the former constitutes the communication of science to non-expert audiences through science popularisation activities and science journalism, the latter includes communicating scientific findings to expert audiences. In other words, a contemporary learner and practitioner of STEMM would soon be expected to be trained in reading and writing skills that enable one to communicate effectively both within and beyond disciplinary silos.

> Policy considerations aside, reading and writing are important for learners & practitioners of STEMM to participate effectively in their disciplines: be it reading literature to identify research questions, reading textbooks as a part of their STEMM education, or to communicate their findings to other practitioners and to members of the public. However, there is evidence indicating STEMM learners and practitioners struggle with these skills. In the context of mathematics education, it has been reported that undergraduate students of mathematics are unable to effectively read their textbooks, and that the difficulties they face in reading and comprehending these textbooks result primarily from the inefficacy of the reading strategies they employ (Shepherd et al., 2009). Thus, in addition to communication skills, training STEMM learners in reading and writing might benefit their engagement with their discipline.
> <p>&nbsp;</p>
> While work on reading strategies that can alleviate challenges such as the one mentioned above is scant, the increased recognition of the importance of science in- and out-reach has propelled several STEMM higher-education institutions to instate science writing and communication courses. The scope and curriculum of these courses vary considerably, as do their duration, their target audience, and the expertise required of the instructors. Further, reading and writing practices in all disciplines, including STEMM, are being tested and transformed rapidly by generative AI technologies. Before deliberating on the uses and abuses of generative AI in STEMM reading and writing contexts, it is imperative to understand the very reading-writing practices that generative AI seeks to intervene in (and perhaps, replace). 
> <p>&nbsp;</p>
> Responding to the opportunity posited by these happenings, the Centre for Writing & Pedagogy and the Mathematics Discipline, School of Interwoven Arts and Sciences, Krea University, are hosting an international symposium on “Reflections on Teaching Reading & Writing in STEMM”. **This symposium brings together an international cohort of scholars and practitioners from different disciplines engaged in the teaching of reading- and writing-oriented courses in STEMM disciplines, as well as courses that focus on reading and writing practices to teach domain knowledge.**
> <p>&nbsp;</p>
> The reflections of this cohort seek to generate a body of empirical and theoretical knowledge that precipitates critical conversations on curricular & pedagogical aspects of teaching reading and writing skills in STEMM, and teaching disciplinary knowledge by attending to reading and writing practices within these disciplines.

> ##### **THEMES**
>Presentations at this symposium explore the following questions and themes:
> <p>&nbsp;</p>
> - **Curricular and pedagogical reflections on teaching reading and/or writing in STEMM**: What are the curricular and pedagogical choices made by teachers of reading-writing courses in STEMM while designing and executing their courses? What frameworks and intentions guide these choices, and what are the challenges and successes of such courses? How are STEMM-specific reading-writing courses different from such courses in other disciplines, and how is the teaching of reading-writing different from courses seeking to train students in domain knowledge?
> - **Sketching the STEMM reading-writing teacher**: Who is the STEMM reading-writing teacher in an Indian context? What makes them take up the teaching of reading and writing in lieu of or in addition to teaching courses in domains of their disciplinary expertise? Do gender, caste, class, sexuality, ability, etc. contribute to who takes up the role of teaching reading-writing in STEMM? What is the relationship of the STEMM reading-writing teacher with ideas of merit, scientific ability, and science identity?
> - **Role of reading-writing in domain-specific STEMM knowledge**: How does the teaching of reading-writing precipitate better engagement with disciplinary knowledge?
> - **Interdisciplinary reflections**: What disciplines have a stake in the teaching of reading-writing in STEMM? What is the role, if any, of a STEMM training in the teaching of reading-writing in STEMM? How do approaches from different disciplines, like history, philosophy, literature, and psychology, inform and shape the teaching of writing in STEMM and science education? 
> - **Empirical investigations into reading and writing in STEMM**: What do findings from qualitative or quantitative study of how STEMM learners and practitioners read and write reveal about effective practices, as well as challenges, of teaching reading and writing in STEMM?
> - **Teaching science communication to STEMM students**: What formal and informal methods may be used to teach STEMM students at different stages to effectively communicate their research to the public?
