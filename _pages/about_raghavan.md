<b>K N Raghavan</b> is currently Professor of Mathematics in the School of Interwoven Arts and Sciences at Krea.   He moved to Krea recently--in the summer of 2024---from the Institute of Mathematical Sciences (Matscience),  where he spent most of his professional career (2001--2024).    Raghavan was educated at IIT Delhi and Purdue University and held positions at Michigan State University and Chennai Mathematical Institute before joining Matscience.  Raghavan's research interests lie in the area of Representation Theory.  He is the co-author with V. Lakshmibai of the monograph in Springer's Encyclopedia of Mathematics series entitled "Standard Monomial Theory, an Invariant Theoretic Approach".    Throughout his tenure at Matscience,  Raghavan was involved in various outreach efforts.   With physicist colleague Gautam Menon,  he started "Science at the Sabha", an annual science outreach event aimed at the general public and held at the Music Academy in Chennai, and ran it for four years 2016--2019, before handing the reins over.
